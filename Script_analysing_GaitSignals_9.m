% This dataset represents the force exerted by a foot on a force sensitive
% resistor. The force is measured in millivolts. Each record is one minute
% in length and contains separate channels for the left and right foot of a
% subject. Each step in the dataset is characterized by a sharp change in
% force as the foot impacts and leaves the ground. Use midcross to find
% these sharp changes for an ALS patient.

%Measure Similarity of Walking Patterns Having quantified the distance
%between steps, proceed to analyze the shape of the gait signal data
%independent of these inter-step variations. Compare two segments of the
%signal using dtw. Ideally, one would compare the shape of the gait signal
%over time as treatment or disease progresses. Here, we compare two
%segments of the same record, one segment taken early in the recording
%(sigsInitialLeft), and the second towards the end (sigsFinalLeft). Each
%segment contains six steps.

%The patient does not walk at the same rate throughout the record. dtw
%provides a measure of the distance between segments by warping them to
%align them in time. Compare the two segments using dtw.

%Construct a Feature Vector to Classify Signals Suppose you are building a
%classifier to decide whether or not a patient is healthy based on a gait
%signals. Investigate the variance of inter-stride times, feature1, and the
%distance via dtw between initial and final signal segments, feature2, as
%classification features.

%ALS patients seem to have a larger variance in their inter-stride times,
%but a smaller distance via dtw between segments. These features compliment
%each other and can be explored for use in a classifier such as a Neural
%Network or Support Vector Machine.
